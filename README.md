# Machine Learning
This is my solution to all the projects of Machine-Learning taught by Andrew Ng. 

This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. 

Topics include:

Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks).
Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning).
Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI).
The course drew from numerous case studies and applications, building perception, control, text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, audio.
